# A Closer Look at Temporal Sentence Grounding in Videos: Datasets and Metrics

We present new splits of Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions, called Charades-CD (Charades-STA under Changing Distributions) and ActivityNet-CD, respectively. These new splits are created by re-organizing all splits (i.e., the training, validation and test set) of original datasets, and the ground truth moment distributions are designed different in the training and test splits, i.e., out-of-distribution (OOD) testing. To better demonstrate the temporal sentence grounding modelsâ€™ generalization ability and compare the performance between the OOD samples and the independent and identically distributed (IID) samples, we also maintain a test split with IID samples, denoted as test-iid (vs. test-ood).
